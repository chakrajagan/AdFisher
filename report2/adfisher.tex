% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[12pt, journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)

\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{mathtools}
% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{graphicx}



% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algpseudocode}
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that

% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil

\begin{abstract}
We propose an auditing framework that can determine whether online advertisement privacy policies are violated.
The framework utilizes abstaining classifiers, where they can not only output positive and negative results but also ``I don't know" predictions.
Such classifiers are useful to reduce the potential cost of privacy policy violation because they can reduce incorrect predictions by reporting ``I don't know" outputs to human for auditing.
We implemented two abstaining classifier algorithms: Ensemble Enumeration and Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration.
We found that compared to traditional classifier selection algorithms, the performance of the predictions are better by abstaining classifiers. 
This project is the first-ever study that combines abstaining classifiers and auditing applications.
Further explorations including more data and more complex models can be utilized to get more insight in this field.

 on the Internet are subjected to targeted advertising in which are provided to them based on their online activities. Most websites outsource their advertising to large third party networks which are dedicated for serving personalized and targeted ads. The users are concerned about these targeted advertisements and want to know what type of information is collected about them by these advertising networks. For this reason, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc. provide ad settings to provide transparency by giving information about what type of information is collected to the user. 
 
When the users are subjected to targeted advertising, their privacy is in question. To mitigate this issue, different entities provide different privacy policies which elaborate on how the information obtained will be used. For example, Google states that it will not associate a cookie with sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation or health \cite{google}. Facebook states that ``Ads may not assert or imply, directly or indirectly, within the ad content or by targeting, a user's personal characteristics within the following categories: race or ethnic origin; religion or philosophical belief; age; sexual orientation or sexual life ...." \cite{fb}. In this way, users are assured about how the data collected about them will and will not be used.
 
 Audits are used to detect violation of privacy policies. These audits are performed with audit algorithms with as little human intervention as possible. These human interventions are necessary to have zero false positives. The audit algorithm reduces every log to a simple set of questions for which it does not know the answers to. Then, human intervention or a better classifier can be used to predict the answer to these questions. Implementation of audits can be helpful in detecting violation of privacy policies in online advertising where zero false positives can be achieved while predicting the output label of a particular data. 
 
Our work is motivated by Datta \textit{et al.} \cite{datta} in which experiments were conducted on Google ads. They developed a tool ``AdFisher" that  can automatically collect advertisements on the Internet. They found some correlations between the user provided data, the websites the user visited and the advertisements they see. The result implies possible violations of Google's privacy policy with respect to use of sensitive information for targeted advertising. 
 
 
In this project, we proposed a automated auditing framework using abstain binary classifiers, which belong to online machine learning algorithms.
Online machine learning algorithms learn one datum at a time, and predict a label from the datum.
The prediction hypothesis is refined if the true label of the datum is learned.
Online machine learning models are suitable for the application of auditing online advertisement privacy settings because the cost of frequently training the classifiers for auditing is quite huge.
By online learning algorithms, the classifiers can be refined (or learned) in the auditing process.
 
Abstaining binary classifiers belong to online machine learning models, where they are allowed to output "I don't know" and refrain from predicting the class label of the given data.
They may abstain from making a prediction if they are not confident enough for the prediction. 
Abstaining classifiers are essential in applications of medical diagnosis and fraud risk assessment because incorrect predictions may contribute to fatal consequences\cite{akshay}.
By utilizing the concept of abstaining classifiers, incorrect predictions are reduced because the classifiers can directly output ``I don't know" if they do not have enough confidence.
After obtaining the ``I don't know" results, expertise can make accurate judgements.

Abstaining classifiers are also suitable for the application on auditing because the incorrect predictions should be reduced.
If the violations of privacy policies are detected internally, it is easy to fix the algorithms that provide targeted advertisements; however, such violations found by the users might contribute to huge costs.

We utilized abstaining classifiers to perform the analysis on the data obtained using AdFisher in previous experiments conducted by Datta \textit{et al.} \cite{datta}.
Abstaining classifiers are integrated into AdFisher to analyze whether the advertisement settings violate their privacy policies.
The paper is organized as follows. Section II reviews some literatures about the experiments on online advertisement settings, and abstaining classifiers. 
Section III described the algorithms we implemented.
We will report the experimental results in Section IV, and state conclusions and future works in Section V.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

\section{Related Work}
To analyze the interactions between Google's Ads, Ad-settings and user activity, an automated tool named AdFisher \cite{datta} was developed by Datta \textit{et al.} The tool works through automation by simulating the interest of users by visiting specific set of websites or by changing the Ad settings in Google. Then, it automates the collection of Google ads from websites and then analyzes it to find if there is a statistically significant difference between the groups of agents. The inputs given to this tool are the behaviors of the two groups and the measurements to make over the agents after the behavior is performed.



Some literatures regarding abstaining classifiers are introduced as follows.
Li \textit{et al.} proposed a learning framework ``Know What it Knows" \cite{KWIK} for online learning
The learning framework is designed to make only accurate predictions although the algorithm can output ``I don't know" for uncertain results.
Theoretical bound on the number of abstaining is discussed by the authors because such algorithm should satisfy the requirements of accurate predictions and minimum abstaining outputs. 


In the survey paper written by Balsubramani \cite{akshay}, the utility of abstaining in binary classifiers is explored in which the paper concentrates on the tradeoff between avoiding incorrect predictions and making sufficiently predictions. 
The paper  \cite{sayedi2010trading} also studies about the tradeoff between "don't know" predictions and making mistakes. It presents an algorithm that minimizes the number of "don't know" predictions bounded by the number of allowed mistakes. 
In addition, Blaszczyski \textit{et al.} proposed a framework of ensembles of abstain classifiers by rule sets \cite{blaszczynski2009ensembles}. 
Moreover, the paper \cite{pietraszek2005optimizing} talks about a method to build a specific type of abstaining binary classifier using ROC analysis. The classifiers are built on cost based model, bounded-abstention model and bounded-improvement model. The paper demonstrates the use of these models on reducing misclassification costs.

Although algorithms and theoretical bounds of abstain classifiers are discussed in those literatures,  there are few applications based on abstaining classifiers.
To best of our knowledge, this project is the first one that integrate abstain classifiers into auditing applications.



\section{Method}
\subsection{Automated Auditing Framework for Online Advertisement Settings}
In this project, we extended the tool ``AdFisher" that abstaining classifiers are integrated. This section first introduces the framework of AdFisher.  
AdFisher is a tool that can automatically collect online advertisements written by Selenium API \cite{selenium} in Python.
Users can first set the treatments for some browser agents.
For example, if we want to determine whether Google Ad-setting is related to discrimination on gender, we can first set different genders in Google Ad-setting page.
After setting treatments, those browser agents then collect online advertisements on websites.

Analyses are then performed to determine whether privacy policies are violated.
The collected advertisements for a browser agent are encoded into one agent vector.
The label of an agent vector is the type of treatment. (e.g. control group or experimental group.)
Machine learning algorithms are utilized to train a model by training data of the vectors, where the learning models can be evaluated by the accuracy of test data.
The next step is to determine whether the prediction results form two different groups.
AdFisher performs permutation tests on the test data, and then report p-value that specifies whether the different treatments contribute to different groups of results.  
After the analyses processes, advertisement companies can use the results to audit their privacy policies.

\subsection{Abstaining Classifiers}
The main contribution of the project is to implement abstaining classifiers in AdFisher framework.
We implemented the classifiers based on ``Know What it Knows" model and the concept of ensemble classifiers.
There are two algorithms in this project: Ensemble Enumeration and Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration, which will be described in the following paragraphs.

\subsubsection{Ensemble Enumeration} 
The Ensemble Enumeration works when the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ is finite.
We first divided the data into training data and testing data, where testing data contains $ \delta \%$ of the entire data set. 
The training data is used to generate $|\mathcal{H}|$ classifiers.
Logistic Regression model is chosen in our experiments because Datta \textit{et al.} \cite{datta} found that such model is suitable in online advertisement applications.
(Note that our abstain classifier framework is flexible that other machine learning models can be easily replaced.)
In order to obtain the hypothesis set, $|\mathcal{H}|$ regularization parameters in logistic regression are set to generate classifiers.

The Ensemble Enumeration algorithm is described after the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ is generated.
\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Ensemble Enumeration}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
   \State $\mathcal{V} \gets \mathcal{H}$  
    \For{$i = 1,2,...$}
      \If{$h(x_i)$ is the same $\forall h \in \mathcal{V}$}
      \State Choose any $h \in \mathcal{V}$ and predict $h(x_i)$
      \Else 
      \State Output ``I don't know"
      \State Predict with the majority, i.e. $\hat{y_{i}} = argmax_{\lambda\in \{-1,+1\} } \{h \in \mathcal{V}: h(x_i)=\lambda)\}$
      \State $\mathcal{V} \gets {h \in \mathcal{V}:h(x_i)=\hat{y_{i}}}$
      \EndIf
      \If{$|\mathcal{V}|=1$}
      \State Terminate with final output $\mathcal{V}$
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The algorithm works depending on the predictions by the classifiers in the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$.
If the predictions are all identical, the abstaining classifier is confident that the result is correct, so it outputs the prediction directly.
However, if there is no consensus among the predictions, the abstaining classifier will output ``I don't know", and update the hypothesis set $\mathcal{H}$ by ensemble that keeps the hypotheses with majority predictions. 

Some properties of the algorithm is described as follows.
The abstention bound in the algorithm is $|\mathcal{H}|-1$ because each time the algorithm outputs an ``I don't know", at least one hypothesis in $\mathcal{V}$ is removed. 
The ensemble step in the algorithm is to aggregate the prediction results by the hypotheses, and remove some unwanted  hypotheses.
Although the Ensemble Enumeration algorithm is quite general and simple, the time and space complexity of the algorithm is huge because the size of the hypothesis set $|\mathcal{H}|$ might be very large.

\subsubsection{Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration}
The assumption of ``Know What it Knows" model is that the learner makes no mistakes, which is a extreme restriction in many circumstances. 
To mitigate the restriction, the enumeration algorithm was extended to allow up to $k$ mistakes in   Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration algorithm.
\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \caption{Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
   \State $\mathcal{V} \gets \mathcal{H}$, $s \gets |\mathcal{H}|^{k/k+1}$, $m \gets 0$
    \For{$i = 1,2,...$}
      \State $\mu = min_{\lambda\in \{-1,+1\}} |\{h \in \mathcal{V}: h(x_i)=\lambda)\}|$, so that $\mu$ is the number of hypotheses in $\mathcal{V}$ predicting the minority label
      \If{$\mu \leq s$}
      \State Predict with the majority, i.e. $\hat{y_{i}} = argmax_{\lambda\in \{-1,+1\} } \{h \in \mathcal{V}: h(x_i)=\lambda)\}$
      \Else 
      \State Output ``I don't know"
      \State $\mathcal{V} \gets {h \in \mathcal{V}:h(x_i)=\hat{y_{i}}}$
      \EndIf
      \If{$|\mathcal{V}|=1$}
      \State Terminate with final output $\mathcal{V}$
      \EndIf
    \EndFor
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration algorithm tolerates some incorrect predictions. Theoretical bound of the algorithm can be found in the paper \cite{sayedi2010trading}.

\subsection{Traditional Classifiers}
This section described how traditional classifiers work. 
We compared the abstaining classifiers to traditional model selection frameworks in the project.
Traditional model selection frameworks utilize cross validation to select the best model for testing process. 
Each model is trained and evaluated the prediction results by cross validation, and the hypothesis with the highest accuracy is selected to be the final classifier.
In our implementation, we used model selection framework to select one of twenty logistic regression classifiers.

\section{Experimental Results}
In the section, we will first introduce the data we used, and then show the experimental results of abstaining classifiers.
\subsection{Data Collection and Evaluation Metric}
We analyzed the data collected by AdFisher. 
Several treatments on browser agents were set to collect online advertisements, including \textit{mental disorder}, \textit{gender effects on job search}, \textit{cars}, and \textit{dating websites}.
A treatment is that the browser agents visit some specific websites and then collect online advertisements on websites such as bbc.com.
For example, the  \textit{cars} treatment is that the browser agent first visits some car websites, and then collects online ads.

We evaluate the accuracy of the results predicted by classifiers. 
There are two possibilities of high accuracy. The first one is that the treatment is effective, so browser agents for different treatments in ``advertisement space" can be separated clearly by simple models. The second one is that the model is suitable for such kind of data, so although browser agents for different treatments in ``advertisement space" are not separated clearly, we can still use the model to separate the data.

We also evaluate p-value of permutation tests.
The p-value can be used to determine whether the effect of the treatments is significant.
If the p-value is smaller than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis that the results of two treatments are identical.
In other words, we can conclude that we have some evidence showing that different treatments contribute to different results by the p-value which is smaller than 0.05. 


\subsection{Comparisons between Abstaining Classifiers and Traditional Classifiers}
Table \ref{mentaldisorder} and \ref{dating} show the prediction accuracy and p-value for different algorithms in the \textit{mental disorder} and \textit{dating} treatments.
We found that the prediction accuracy in traditional classifiers is low, which is near random prediction. The p-value is high in traditional classifiers. 
Although by the abstaining classifier we merely obtained slightly higher prediction accuracy, we achieved the p-value smaller than 0.05, so we have some evidence that the \textit{mental disorder} and \textit{dating} treatments contribute to different set of online advertisements.

Table \ref{cars} shows the results in the \textit{cars} treatment.
The accuracy of the three algorithms are relatively higher compared to the \textit{mental disorder} treatment, and p-values are very small.
The accuracy in the abstain classifier is higher than traditional classifiers, which shows that abstain classifier algorithms can effectively enhance the performance.

Table \ref{gender} shows the case that the results of prediction accuracy are low, and p-values are high.
In this case, we have no evidence that the results of different gender treatments on job search are different.
There are two possibilities to interpret the result. The first one is that the collected online advertisements are not related to gender discrimination. The other one is that it is difficult to separate browser agents in different treatments in the ``advertisement space".

\subsection{Discussion}
The results show that the performance of abstaining classifiers is better than traditional classifiers on the collected data.
However, there are some limitations in the project.

The first limitation is the size of data. In fact, there are only hundreds of browser agents because it takes a lot of time to collect online advertisements.
Because if the small size of data, we cannot conclude that the results can be generalized to all cases.
If the size of data can be scaled up, we might obtain significant results and then we will gain much more insights on the usage and the applications of abstaining classifiers.

Second, the design of hypothesis set can be refined. 
The ``Know What it Knows" model is designed to predict bounded incorrect results.
However, due to the time limitation, we could only generate the hypothesis set by using different parameters in logistic regression model.
We believe that if more complex design of hypothesis set and learning models are utilized, we will obtain much better performances on both prediction accuracy and p-value results. 
\section{Conclusion and Future works}
In the project, we proposed an auditing framework for online advertisement settings by using abstaining classifiers.
We extended the tool ``AdFisher" by implementing two abstaining classifier algorithms: Ensemble Enumeration and Ensemble Relaxed Enumeration.
The results show that the performance on abstaining classifiers are better than traditional model selection algorithms because abstaining classifiers output ``I don't know" on uncertain results.

There are some possible future works on the project.
First, in order to obtain more significant results, more data on online advertisements should be collected.
More browser agents can be used to attain the goal.
The other way to refine the work is to design more complex machine learning models.
For example, the design of hypothesis set in abstaining classifiers is essential for significant results.
Also, the proposed framework is flexible that it can combine different machine learning models in the learning process.
By ensemble for different learning models, we believe that we will obtain higher accuracy on the prediction of browser agents, and then we will gain more insights on the application of auditing on privacy policies.
