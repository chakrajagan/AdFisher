% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[journal]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex

\usepackage{graphicx}



% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -

% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by

% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:

% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} 
 effectiveness of ad campaigns have inflated due to targeted marketing, which has been made possible through websites which track user data and thereby predict a user's interests. This raises a lot of concerns for the user, who would like to know which set of personal information they provide is used for targeted advertising. For this reason, the websites that acquire or collect the personal information from users tell them which set of this information will be used for targeting and which set is not used through their privacy policy. However, we cannot directly determine whether these policies are complied. They can be ascertained by conducting indirect experiments such as analyzing the ads that the user encounters on the internet. 
 
Google and Facebook are two of the largest ad providing platforms. Our work is motivated by Datta et al. \cite{datta} in which experiments were conducted on Google ads. They found some correlations between the user provided data, the websites the user visited and the advertisements they see. The result implies possible violations of Google's privacy policy with respect to use of sensitive information for targeted advertising.
In our project, we adopted a similar approach given in \cite{datta}, and our goal is to ascertain if Facebook ads are in compliance to their privacy policy/guidelines. 
We extended the tool \textit{AdFisher} developed by Datta et al. \cite{datta} so that it can automatically login using Facebook accounts, and collect the ads shown on Facebook News Feed.

In the following sections, we will first describe the extension of AdFisher, and then several experiments will be stated. Finally, we will discuss the next steps in the project.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a

%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}

%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.

\section{Extension on AdFisher}
In this section, we will describe how to extend AdFisher to Facebook. There are two modules: account authentication and advertisements collection. By using these functions, we can easily analyze the ads on Facebook by AdFisher.
\subsection{Account Authentication}
The module will first visit Facebook (www.facebook.com), and the login by typing the Facebook account and password. We obtained the goal by using Selenium \cite{selenium}, the python API used in AdFisher. 

First, we locate the text area that is for account, and then type the account by the using this function: \texttt{email=driver.find\_element\_by\_name("email") email.send\_keys("ACCOUNT") }

Second, we use the same way to insert the password into the password area. 
In order to really login into Facebook, the ``Log In" button on the webpage or the key \textit{return} on the keyboard should be clicked. We use this code  \texttt{Keys.RETURN} in Selenium that simulates a ``click" action of the keyboard to login.

\subsection{Advertisements Collection}
In the section, we will describe how we collect the ads from Facebook. Figure \ref{fb_ad} is an example of a Facebook Ad. The ad is located in a container where the class name of the container object is `\textit{`ego\_unit"}. The class name of the title of an ad is \textit{``\_5vwh"}; also, the class name of the hyperlink to the ad is \textit{``\_4xvg"}; moreover, the class name of the ad content is \textit{``\_5vwk"}. In the example ad, the ad title is ``SPANX.com Official Site", the hyperlink is ``spanx.com", and the ad content is ``Shop the ... Free  Shipping!"

By analyzing the HTML attributes, we can use Selenium to collect the ads by using the procedure below:
\texttt{find\_elements\_by\_class\_name("ego\_unit")
find\_elements\_by\_class\_name("\_5vwh")
find\_elements\_by\_class\_name("\_4xvg")
find\_elements\_by\_class\_name("\_5vwk")
}

After collecting the information including title, hyperlink, and the content of an ad, we store it into the log the file by using the format that AdFisher uses for further analysis.

\begin{figure}[!t]\centering\includegraphics[width=2.0in]{fbad}\caption{An example of Facebook ad.}\label{fb_ad}\end{figure}


\section{Issues on new Facebook accounts}
We will discuss the relationship between a newly created Facebook account and the ads on its News Feed in the section. In the experimental design in our proposal, we would like to create eight accounts and divided them into two groups: control group and experimental group. After different treatments on these two groups, we would like to determine whether there is a statistical difference between the two sets of ads collected by these two groups.

However, we found that there is no ads in a new Facebook account. In contrast, there are two ads in our personal Facebook accounts. If we analyze the ads on our existing Facebook accounts, there must be many confounding factors that affect the results of the experiments. To be more specific, we cannot conclude that the treatments such as visiting shopping websites in our experiments really affect the collected ads because of those confounding factors. In order to ensure the causality of our experiments, we first investigated how to make a new Facebook account show an ad.

The first experiment is to investigate the relationship between the ads and the followed fan pages. Our hypothesis is that the number of followed online-shopping-fan-pages will contribute to online shopping ads on News Feed for a new Facebook account. Because Facebook does not provide the top list of its fan pages, we visited \textit{alexa.com} \cite{alexa} and followed the fan pages of top 50 online clothing shopping websites.  

In the experiment, the account followed a fan page from the list obtained from \textit{alexa.com}, and then collected the ads for twenty reloads. We sequently followed the fan pages by the rank on the list. However, we did not obtain significant results in the experiment. In fact, we did not obtain any ads after following 50 online clothing shopping fan pages. The result shows that following fan pages merely is not enough to show the ads. It implies that there must be other factors that affect the ads on the News Feed for a new Facebook account.  
\section{Comparison of two accounts}
In this experiment, the Facebook accounts of Jagannathan and Hsin were used to collect ads. This experiment was done to know if the ads served to the two users were inherently different.  For treatment 1, Jagannathan's profile was used and for treatment 2, Hsin's profile was used. In both the treatments, the users were logged in to Facebook and the ads were collected immediately. The experiment was run for 20 blocks with 10 reloads in each block. The total number of ads collected for each user was 392 and 400 for Hsin and Jagannathan respectively. These ads were subjected to analysis and p-value for this experiment was found for different splitfrac values. Splitfrac value determines what percentages of the samples should be used for training and testing. The results are shown in Table \ref{twoaccounts}. The p-value less than 0.05 is considered a significant value. These results hint at the possibility that the two users were indeed served different ads.

\section{The effect on Online shopping websites}
In this experiment, the Facebook account of one user was used to collect ads after exposing that user to online shopping (clothing) websites. This was done to determine whether there is a correlation between the ads that are served to the user and the user's online activity. The experiment was set up such that the ads were collected after the user has been exposed to websites related to online shopping in one treatment and in another treatment, the user remained idle and then the ads were collected from Facebook. The experiment was run for 15 blocks with 10 reloads in each block. The total number of ads that were collected for the two treatments were 303 and 296 respectively . These ads were subjected to analysis and p-value for this experiment was found for different splitfrac values. The results are shown in Table \ref{oneaccountClothing}.

This indicates that the online browsing activity might not have any immediate effect on the ads served to the user on Facebook. The reasons for this might be that the number of websites to which the user was exposed to might not be big enough to create a significant impact on the ads served to the user, or that the time needed for the browsing activity to affect the ads served might not be immediate.

\section{Next steps}
The goal of our project is to determine whether Facebook complies its Advertising Guidelines \cite{fbguideline}. To be more specific, we will focus on the policy: ``Ads may not assert or imply, directly or indirectly, within the ad content or by targeting, a user's personal characteristics within the disability or medical condition." We plan to expose the experimental group to websites related to medical conditions and ``Like" related pages on Facebook and find if there is any statistical difference between the ads shown to the control group and the experimental group. Therefore, we should ensure that only the treatment in the experimental group will affect the ads. 

To attain this goal, we will first discover some ways to show ads on new Facebook accounts. There are some possibilities we can try. For example, we will try whether the visit of online shopping websites will lead to online shopping ads in new Facebook accounts. After we investigate the ways to show the ads on News Feed for new accounts, we can conduct further experiments that examine whether Facebook complies its 
Advertising Guidelines.

In addition, the next step would be to scale up the experiment for the comparison of different accounts in which ten browsers will be used to collect advertising data over 100 blocks so that a significant number of ads are gathered. The experiment would be set up in such a way that five browsers will login as one user and the other five as another user.

Moreover, the next step for the experiment that finds the relationship between online shopping websites and ads would be to increase the online activities of the users by increasing the number of websites to be visited. Also, the measurement can be scaled up so that more ads can be collected to determine if there is any significant difference in the ads served based on the online activity of the user.
